# talkr
{talkr} offers a set of convenience functions for quality control, visualisation and analysis of conversational data. It provides support for at least two common needs of people working with conversational corpora: (1) quality control by offering rapid insights into the nature, timing, and quality of time-aligned annotations in a conversational corpus; and (2) compelling visualisations by offering a range of plotting functions that play well with ggplot and the tidyverse. 

Note: {talkr} plays well with its companion python package `scikit-talk`, which is focused more on processing conversational data and readying it for downstream analysis.
